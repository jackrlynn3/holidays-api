# Holidays API UI

Holidays are **import** because they symbolize **what a culture or region values**. However, remembering when holidays happen is tricky, so the **Holidays API UI** takes in hundreds of **US and international holidays** from the [Time and Date API](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/) and allows the user to view their holiday lists. Furthermore, users can **add** and **delete** holidays to their wishes and then **save** their holiday lists to a **JSON file** to then use later on. This UI functions entirely on command-line-enabled Python.

## How to Run

**Prerequisite:** Requires Python 3.8 or later.

**Step 1:** Download the Git repository from [here](https://github.com/jackrlynn3/word-guessing-game).

**Step 2:** Download the `config.py` file, and make sure it is in the same directory as the rest of the project; it should be in the same directory level as `main.py`. You will have to get your own keys and accounts for both the [Time and Date API](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/) and the [OpenWeather API](https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map). See their respective websites for more details.

**Step 3:** Open your Terminal window or your operating system's equivalent command line.

**Step 4:** Run the following Python command to get JSON file:

    python main.py
