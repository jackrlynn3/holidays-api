[.circle] getWeather() is called
  Get the current day of the week using datetime
    Intialize dictionary variable that converts date into weather
      Determine how many days of forecast are needed
        Get all future forecasts in this week, i.e., all weather predictions, by querying OpenWeathers prediction API
          Convert the weather predictions to JSON format
            Convert the predictions to a list format
              [iteration] Starting from the day after today, iterate forwards until Sunday
                Extract the weather data for that day
                  Save the weather data to the dictionary
                    [.diamond] Is this day Sunday?
                      No: (iteration)
                      Yes: End prediction iteration
                        Determine how many days of already past weather need to be gathered
                          [iteration2] Iterate through these forcasts backwards from today
                            Query the OpenWeather historical API for the current day
                              Convert the data to JSON format
